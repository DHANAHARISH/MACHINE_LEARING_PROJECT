# MACHINE_LEARING_PROJECT
# Smart Manufacturing of Copper Products: Integrating IoT and Industrial Modeling
**Introduction**

The "IndustrialCopperModeling" project aims to address challenges faced by the copper industry in dealing with less complex data related to sales and pricing. The data may suffer from skewness and noise, affecting the accuracy of manual predictions. To overcome these challenges, the project proposes the implementation of machine learning regression and classification models using advanced techniques like data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection.

**Description**

The project focuses on two main aspects

-  **Regression Modeling** Predicting the continuous variable 'Selling_Price' using machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, exploration of skewness and outliers, and model building.

-  **Classification Modeling** Developing a lead classification model based on the 'STATUS' variable, classifying leads as 'WON' or 'LOST.' This involves handling imbalance, exploring and treating skewness, and creating a classification model.

The solution includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and a Streamlit-based GUI for interactive predictions.

**Objectives**
- Develop proficiency in Python programming and data analysis libraries.
- Gain experience in data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization.
- Understand and visualize data through EDA techniques like boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.
- Learn and apply advanced machine learning techniques for regression and classification.
- Build and optimize machine learning models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.
- Acquire experience in feature engineering techniques to create informative data representations.
- Develop a web application using Streamlit to showcase and make predictions using the models.
- Understand challenges and best practices in the manufacturing domain and apply machine learning solutions.

**Data Understanding/Variables Explanation**

- **id** Unique identifier for each transaction or item.

- **item_date Date** of recording or occurrence of each transaction or item.
  
- **quantity tons** Quantity of the item in tons for inventory management.

- **customer** Customer identifier for tracking sales and relationships.

- **country** Country associated with each customer for geographic insights.

- **status** Current status of the transaction or item.

- **item type** Categorization of the items being sold or produced.

- **application** Specific use or application of the items for tailored efforts.

- **thickness, width, material_ref, product_ref** Details about the items.

- **delivery date** Expected or actual delivery date for each item.

- **selling_price** Price at which the items are sold.

**Project Motive**

The project aims to equip individuals with practical skills in data analysis, machine learning modeling, and creating interactive web applications. It provides a foundation to solve real-world problems in the manufacturing domain, addressing challenges related to data quality, model accuracy, and decision-making.
